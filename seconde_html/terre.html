                <h5>Size</h5>
                <p>
                    The Earth's diameter is approximately 12,742 km (7,918 miles),<br>
                    making it the fifth largest planet in our solar system.

                <h5>Atmosphere:</h5>
                <p>
                    The Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen,<br>
                    21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases.<br>
                    This composition is essential for supporting life on the planet.

                <h5>Water:</h5>
                <p>
                    About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water,<br>
                    primarily oceans, which play a crucial role in regulating<br>
                    the planet's climate and supporting marine life.

                <h5>Rotation:</h5>
                <p>
                    The Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours,<br>
                    which causes the cycle of day and night.<br>
                    It also has a slight tilt of 23.5Â° relative to its orbit,<br>
                    which is responsible for the changing seasons.

                <h5>Life</h5>
                <p>
                    Earth is the only known planet to support life,<br>
                    thanks to its unique conditions, such as liquid water,<br>
                    an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a relatively stable climate.
