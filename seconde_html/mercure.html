                <h5>Proximity to the Sun:</h5>
                <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun,<br> with an average distance of 57.9 million kilometers (35.98 million miles) from the Sun.</p>

                <h5>Extreme temperatures:</h5>
                <p>
                    Mercury experiences extreme temperatures.<br>
                     Due to its lack of a significant atmosphere,<br>
                     surface temperatures can reach up to 430째C (800째F) during the day,<br>
                     while nighttime temperatures drop to about -180째C (-290째F).
                </p>

                <h5>Slow rotation:</h5>
                <p>
                    Mercury takes 58.6 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis,<br>
                     but its revolution around the Sun only takes 88 Earth days.<br>
                     This means that a day on Mercury is longer than a year on Mercury.

                <h5>No thick atmosphere: </h5>
                <p>
                    Mercury has a very thin atmosphere,<br>
                    composed mainly of sodium, helium, and oxygen<br>
                    This atmosphere cannot trap heat from the Sun,<br>
                    leading to extreme temperature variations.<br>

            <div>
                <h5>No natural satellites:</h5>
                <p>
                    Mercury has no moons, unlike Earth and other planets like Mars and Jupiter.
