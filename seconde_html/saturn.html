                <p>
                    Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system,<br>
                    with a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers (72,366 miles),<br>
                    making it about 9 times wider than Earth.<br>

                <h5>Rings</h5>
                <p>
                    Saturn is most famous for its extensive ring system<br>
                     made up of ice and rock particles.<br>
                     The rings are divided into several sections,<br> 
                     and they span up to 280,000 kilometers (174,000 miles) in diameter,<br>
                     although they are only about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) thick.<br>

                <h5>Composition</h5>
                <p>
                    Saturn is a gas giant, primarily<br>
                    composed of hydrogen and helium.<br>
                    It lacks a solid surface, and its atmosphere<br>
                    contains clouds of ammonia, methane, and water vapor.

                <h5>Moons</h5>
                <p>
                    Saturn has 146 known moons, with Titan being the largest.<br>
                    Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere,<br>
                    which makes it a subject of interest for scientists studying the potential for life.

                <h5>Rotation</h5>
                <p>
                    Saturn has a very short day, completing one rotation in just about 10.7 hours.<br>
                    However, it has a longer year, taking about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
