                <p>
                    Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system,<br>
                    with a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles),<br>
                    making it more than 11 times wider than Earth.
                </p>

                <h5>Atmosphere</h5>
                <p>
                    Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily made up of hydrogen (about 90%)<br>
                    and helium (about 10%). It also features iconic storm systems,<br>
                    including the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries.

                <h5>Moons</h5>
                <p>
                    Jupiter has 95 known moons, including the four largest:<br>
                    Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, also known as the Galilean moons,<br>
                    discovered by Galileo in 1610.

                <h5>Magnetic Field: </h5>
                <p>
                    Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system,<br>
                    which is about 14 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field traps particles,<br>
                    creating intense radiation belts around the planet.

                <h5>Rings:</h5>
                <p>
                    While not as prominent as Saturn's,<br>
                    Jupiter also has a faint ring system made of small,<br>
                    dark particles that are difficult to see from Earth.<br>
                    These rings were first discovered by the Voyager spacecraft in 1979.
