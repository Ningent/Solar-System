                <h5>Similar size to Earth:</h5>
                <p>
                    Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" because its size,<br>
                    composition, and mass are similar to Earth.<br>
                    Its diameter is about 95% that of Earth's,<br>
                    and it is only slightly smaller.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Extreme temperatures:</h5>
                <p>
                    Venus has an incredibly hot surface temperature,<br>
                    averaging around 465°C (869°F).<br>
                    This makes it the hottest planet in the solar system,<br>
                    even hotter than Mercury, despite being farther from the Sun.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Thick atmosphere:</h5>
                <p>
                    Venus has a dense atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide,<br>
                    with clouds of sulfuric acid. This thick atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect,<br>
                    trapping heat and causing the extreme temperatures.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5>Slow rotation:</h5>
                <p>
                    Venus has an unusually slow rotation.<br>
                    It takes about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis,<br>
                    making its day longer than its year, which lasts about 225 Earth days.<br>
                    It also rotates in the opposite direction to most planets,<br>
                    including Earth, meaning the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.

            <div>
                <h5>No moons:</h5>
                <p>
                    Like Mercury, Venus does not have any moons.<br>
                    Despite being similar in size and composition to Earth,<br>
                    it lacks the natural satellites that Earth has.<br>
