                <p>
                    Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet<br>
                    from the Sun in our solar system, with a diameter <br>
                    of about 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles). <br>
                    It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter <br>
                    and is slightly smaller than Uranus.

                <h5>Atmosphere</h5>
                <p>
                    Neptune's atmosphere is made primarily of hydrogen,<br>
                    helium, and methane, giving the planet its blue color. <br>
                    The methane in its atmosphere absorbs red light, reflecting blue light. <br>
                    It also has dynamic weather patterns, including powerful winds and storms.

                <h5>Winds:</h5>
                <p>
                    Neptune is known for having the strongest winds <br>
                    in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers <br>
                    per hour (1,300 miles per hour). <br>
                    These winds contribute to the planet's <br>
                    turbulent weather systems and large storm formations.

                <h5>Moons and Rings:</h5>
                <p>
                    Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest.<br>
                    Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite<br>
                    direction (retrograde orbit), suggesting it may have been<br>
                    captured by Neptune's gravity. <br>
                    Neptune also has a faint ring system made up of five known rings.

                <h5>Temperature: </h5>
                <p>
                    Despite being farther from the Sun than Uranus,<br>
                    Neptune is warmer, with an average temperature <br>
                    of about -214°C (-353°F). This suggests that Neptune <br>
                    has an internal heat source, possibly from its core, <br>
                    that keeps it warmer than expected.
